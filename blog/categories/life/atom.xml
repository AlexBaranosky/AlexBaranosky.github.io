    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Theeee other day some colleagues and I drove into downtown San Mateo for lunch.  An interesting decision had to be made: how many quarters to pay the meter.</p>

<p>The price for parking is $0.25 per half hour. Your penny-pinching instincts suggest to only put in 2 quarters.  Let&rsquo;s say that a parking ticket for going over the meter is $40.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down the Scenario</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s apply a little reasoning and mathematics to this, situation and see what&rsquo;s the right amount of quarters to put into the meter.</p>

<p>There are 5 possible outcomes:</p>

<ol>
<li>pay $0.50, go under one hour, no ticket: total price $0.50</li>
<li>pay $0.50, go over one hour, no ticket: total price $0.50</li>
<li>pay $0.50, go over one hour, get ticket: total price $40.50</li>
<li>pay $0.75, go under one hour, no ticket: total price $0.75</li>
<li>pay $0.75, go over one hour, no ticket: total price $0.75</li>
</ol>


<h2>Conservative Guesstimates</h2>

<p>Now the fun part.  Let&rsquo;s assign rough guesstimates of likelihood for each outcome.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be generous and say that you only go over one hour 20% of the time, and only 20% of the times you go over do you get a ticket.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s also say that you pay $0.50 half the time and $0.75 half the time.</p>

<ol>
<li>40% probability x $0.50 = $0.20</li>
<li>8% probability x $0.50 = $0.04</li>
<li>2% probability x $40.50 = $0.81</li>
<li>40% probability x $0.75 = $0.30</li>
<li>10% probability x $0.75 = $0.075</li>
</ol>


<p>Computed average cost: $1.425</p>

<p>Even at the conservative rate of ticketing of 20% of time you go over an hour, you still increase your expected rate of pay to almost double, by choosing to pay $0.50 half the time!</p>

<h2>With Vigilant Meter Maids</h2>

<p>If instead you think you&rsquo;ll get a ticket 75% of the time you go over, the average cost per park becomes a whopping $3.625</p>

<ol>
<li>40% probability x $0.50 = $0.20</li>
<li>2.5% probability x $0.50 = $0.0125</li>
<li>7.5% probability x $40.50 = $3.0375</li>
<li>40% probability x $0.75 = $0.30</li>
<li>10% probability x $0.75 = $0.075</li>
</ol>


<p>Computed average cost: $3.625</p>

<p>So it looks like in general it pays to be safe and pay the extra quarter when parking in downtown San Mateo.</p>

<h2>Further Precision</h2>

<p>We could expand this further, by considering likelihoods of lunch going over 1.5 hours.  I didn&rsquo;t because I think there&rsquo;s diminishing returns on investment because the odds of going over 1.5 hours are probably only like 20% of 20% => 4%&hellip;  I&rsquo;ll leave that as an exercise for the reader :)</p>
